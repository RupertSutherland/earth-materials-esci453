Copper Worksheet Notes 

Data Sources
The sources of data for the copper worksheet are the mineral statistics publications of the U.S. Bureau of Mines and the U.S. Geological Survey—Minerals Yearbook (MYB) and its predecessor, Mineral Resources of the United States (MR), and Metal Prices in the United States through 1998 (MP98). The years of publication and corresponding years of data coverage are listed in the References section below. 

Primary Production
Primary U.S. copper production data report the amount of refined copper produced from ore, concentrate, or precipitate. This includes copper recovered from primary domestic sources as well as copper recovered from imported blister anodes, concentrates and ores that are further processed in domestic facilities to a refined form. Also included with primary copper production is copper recovered as cathodes from the solvent extraction-electrowinning process associated with dump, heap or roast-leach operations. Currently, all primary refined copper is recovered as electrolytic or electrowon cathode, though historically, some fire-refined copper was produced. All primary production data were reported in the MR and the MYB.

Secondary Production
U.S. copper production data reported as secondary production are the amounts of copper recovered from old scrap. Old scrap refers to obsolete or discarded end-use items that are recycled. Old scrap may be processed into refined copper or used in the production of castings, mill products, chemicals, and other products. Secondary production data were reported in the MR and the MYB. Data were not available for 1900–05.

New Scrap
New scrap represents the quantity of copper that is recovered from copper and copper alloy scrap generated during manufacturing (turnings, stampings, defective parts, etc.) and returned to smelters, fire refineries, brass mills, etc. for reprocessing. It may be directly melted into new products or processed into refined copper. It does not include home or runaround scrap generated within a plant and reprocessed at the same plant. New scrap data were reported in the MR and the MYB. Data were not available for 1900–05.

Refinery Scrap
Refinery scrap is refined copper produced from both new and old scrap. The scrap may have been processed through smelting and electrolytic refining or directly processed at a fire refinery to produce a cast shape. In the former, the raw material (scrap) is based on the smelter level consumption. Production data were reported in the MR and the MYB. Data were not available for 1900–05. 

Imports
Import data reported in the MYB are the amounts of refined copper imported into the United States in various shapes and forms. Import data exclude all semifabricated and manufactured copper products. Imports for 1900–33 are general imports. Imports for 1934–79 include copper imported for immediate consumption plus material entering the country under bond and are comparable to general imports. The 1981 MYB started reporting imports for consumption in the “U.S. imports for consumption of unmanufactured copper, by country” table.

Exports
Export data reported in the MYB are the amounts of refined copper exported from the United States in various shapes and forms. Export data exclude all semifabricated and manufactured copper products.

Stocks
Stocks are the sum of available data on refined copper held by producers, consumers, government, and commodity exchange warehouses as of December 31 of each year and reported in the MR and the MYB. For 1900–33, reported data includes only producer stocks (refineries) of refined copper. For 1934–54, stock data are the sum of producer stocks of refined copper and wire mill stocks of refined copper reported in the MYB. Data on stocks of refined copper for industry and government for 1955–89 were from the “U.S. Refined Copper Inventories, End of Year” table in the 1990 MYB. This table also includes government stockpile inventories at the end of each year back to 1955. Beginning in 1975, the MYB reported data on stocks of refined copper at brass mills, wire rod mills, other manufacturers, and the New York Commodities Exchange, in addition to primary producers. London Metal Exchange Ltd. stocks in newly opened U.S. warehouses were included beginning in 1995.

Consumption
Reported consumption is the quantity of refined copper used by the domestic industry (brass mills, wire-rod mills, foundries, etc.), as measured by direct survey of the copper consuming industries, in the production of semi fabricates, castings, chemicals, etc. in the United States. This category has been referred to as “use” in the MYB and the MR.

Apparent Consumption
The apparent consumption of copper in the United States for 1900 to the most recent year was estimated using the following equation:

APPARENT CONSUMPTION = PRIMARY PRODUCTION + SECONDARY PRODUCTION + IMPORTS – EXPORTS ± STOCK CHANGES.

All stock data are for the end of the calendar year so beginning stocks are defined as the previous year’s ending stocks. Estimates for apparent consumption for 1955 to the most recent year are reported in the MYB. Data for 1998 to the most recent year use general imports instead of imports for consumption.

Unit Value ($/t)
Unit value is the value in actual U.S. dollars of 1 metric ton (t) of refined copper apparent consumption. Unit value is estimated from the “Annual Average U.S. Producer Copper Price” as reported in the MP98 and the MYB.

Unit Value (98$/t)
The Consumer Price Index conversion factor, with 1998 as the base year, is used to adjust unit value in current U.S. dollars to the unit value in constant 1998 U.S. dollars.

World Production
World mine production is based on a compilation of available country data published in the MR and the MYB and generally reflects the copper content of concentrates, precipitates, and electrowon copper. For some countries, including the United States, recoverable copper content is used. For other countries, such as Chile, data includes copper content of non-duplicative mine and metal products produced from domestic ores and concentrates. This data set was originally derived from the MR and the MYB series, but data for 1940–85, may contain revisions to specific countries that reflect new understandings of production, especially for the former Soviet Union as reported by Strishkov (1984, p. 8).
